Redacted is a compact single-player card game built with Flutter, where you face off against a CPU opponent in a battle of strategy and logic.

Inspired by the classic mathematical game Nim, Redacted hides its origins behind its name, so players canâ€™t simply Google their way to victory.

## Purpose

This project was built to demonstrate practical game development skills using Flutter, including:

- Turn-based gameplay and game state management

- A simple but effective AI opponent

- Smooth and responsive UI/UX design

- Cross-platform compatibility (mobile + desktop)
